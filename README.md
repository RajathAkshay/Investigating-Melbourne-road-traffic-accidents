# Investigating-Melbourne-road-traffic-accidents
Road traffic accidents have emerged to be an important global health crisis and cities are investing on multi-disciplinary approaches to tackle the issue. With an exponentially growing population in a city like Melbourne, it becomes a priority for us to investigate on road crashes to identify patterns and possible reason for the events. An article from World Bank reported how road crashes can impact financial stability of an individual and affects the poverty in a city than we probably thought. This motivated me to analyze road traffic accidents in Melbourne in the past 5 years to identify patterns and deduce possible reasons for the event to occur. I will be exploring the data to answer the following questions: v How time/location of the road accidents is co-related to the location of pubs/bars. v Find trends with the volume of vehicles, speed zone, road geometry, lighting, the day of the week and road crashes. v Trends with "Hit and run" cases and the speed-limit of that road. v Pattern in the type of accident over months of a year. v Trends on road geometry and accidents to determine dangerous road geometry. v Determine the correlation between accident type, alcohol time, road geometry and casualties. This report takes you on a journey to understand better about road traffic accidents and investigate the patterns observed to determine the possible events causing the pattern in Melbourne road accident data.
