# Investigating-Melbourne-road-traffic-accidents
Road traffic accidents have emerged to be an important global health crisis and cities are investing on multi-disciplinary approaches to tackle the issue. With an exponentially growing population in a city like Melbourne, it becomes a priority for us to investigate on road crashes to identify patterns and possible reason for the events. An article from World Bank reported how road crashes can impact financial stability of an individual and affects the poverty in a city than we probably thought. This motivated me to analyze road traffic accidents in Melbourne in the past 5 years to identify patterns and deduce possible reasons for the event to occur. I will be exploring the data to answer the following questions: v How time/location of the road accidents is co-related to the location of pubs/bars.
Find trends with the volume of vehicles, speed zone, road geometry, lighting, the day of the week and road crashes.
Trends with "Hit and run" cases and the speed-limit of that road. v Pattern in the type of accident over months of a year.
Trends on road geometry and accidents to determine dangerous road geometry.
Determine the correlation between accident type, alcohol time, road geometry and casualties. This report takes you on a journey to understand better about road traffic accidents and investigate the patterns observed to determine the possible events causing the pattern in Melbourne road accident data.


In consideration of global health crisis caused by road traffic accidents, I have performed deep dive exploratory analysis on the road crashes in Melbourne for the past 5 years (2014-2018). Initial investigation on the location of accidents revealed that Brimbank and Melbourne city are considered most accident prone regions in Melbourne. On the other hand, Cardinia and Melton are the safest regions with low road crash and fatality count in the whole of Melbourne.
We also learnt that Friday constantly turned out to be the day with highest road crashes over the years and Sunday to be lowest. However, we failed to relate the number of accidents on Friday to the location of pub/bar. Never the less, we discovered that collision with vehicle, fixed object and pedestrian is the most common and dangerous type of accident while 60km/h and 80km/h non-intersecting roads one of the most dangerous roads in Melbourne.
Investigating the correlation between months of a year to the number of road accidents, we discovered that March was constantly prone to accidents while September contributed least towards the road crashes over the past 5 years (2014-2018). In search of patterns that are causing the rice of accidents during march revealed the following:
• A peak in number of collision with vehicle reports during the month of march (Accident type).
• Significant increase in the number of crashes on a non-intersecting roads (Road geometry).
• Road crashes by young drivers (age 18-25) is highest during the month of March.
• A strange peak in road crashes at Dusk/Dawn during march and October.
• Number of Public holidays are known to be the highest during march.
• Perfect Temperature and lowest rainfall supports the hypothesis of increased number of
vehicles on roads heading to an excursion causing the rise in road crashes.
We also conclude that accidents which involves collision with vehicle during the alcohol time on a cross intersection is the most dangerous accident with the highest risk on fatality.
